This is a flax picking script.

-Start either in Camelot bank or in Flax field (or anywhere in between).
-Remember that if you have a bank pin to select your account in the bot client settings or manually input pin before starting script.

This script was made by neoxyte exclusively for hexbot.org! This script shall remain open source and is intended for submission in my script writer application. Screenshots are available under the progress_screenshots folder!

TODO:
-Improve antiban
-Implement zybez price search (at the moment I just used 35gp as the price for flax. I need to change this so it updates in the rare event that the street price of flax flucuates).
-GUI ( I don't think this is necessary but if more advanced antiban is implemented then a GUI would allow people to toggle/configure such system.

Thanks for checking out this script! Expect many more to come.
