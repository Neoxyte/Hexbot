Hi this is my Flax picking script for hexbot.org!

At the moment it is functional and in version 1.0. 

Simply start in camelot bank or in the flax field!

To be updated:
-Paint (I suck with graphics)
-Antiban (I want to make it more human like. 
	  So far the only anti ban is some camera movements)
-GUI (I don't think this is absolutely necessary but I need the practice with GUI making.

Thanks for checking out my script.
